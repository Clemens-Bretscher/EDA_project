## Data Analysis on the prices of houses in King County
This repository contains an analysis of various factors on the housing prices in King County. I did this work for a fictional client who wants to buy and sell houses in poor neighbourhoods in King county. He does not want to make big profits, but rather wants to act socially responsible.

<p> I analysed the data following three hypothesis:</p><p> H01: The price depends on the zip code</p><p>
H02: When the house is next to a body of water (waterfront) the price will be higher </p><p>
H03: The lower the grade of the house the lower the price will be </p>
<p>
The different hypotheses are investigated in three different Jupyter notebooks (Hypothesis_1, Hypothesis_2, Hypothesis_3)
</p>
<p>
The pdf file Presentation Prices of Houses in King County gives an overview of the findings. </p>
<p>
The figures folder contains figures that were exported from the notebooks and used in the presentation file. </p>
<p>The requirements file contains all the used environment libraries</p>
